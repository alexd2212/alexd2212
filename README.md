👋 About me

Hi! I'm a Web Application Development (DAW) student, and I'm currently at a stage where I'm passionate about diving into the world of new technologies. My main goal is to expand my knowledge in both front-end and back-end development. I firmly believe that having a solid foundation in both areas will give me the ability to tackle and find creative solutions to any problem that arises.

🌱 I’m currently learning ...

I'm currently focused on expanding my knowledge in both front-end and back-end development to become a versatile problem solver.

👯 I’m looking forward to collaborate on open source projects.

I'm eager to collaborate on open-source projects and learn from others in the community.

✔ Ask me about anything, I am happy to help

Feel free to ask me anything, I'm always happy to share what I know and learn from your questions.

Outside tech,

💜 I enjoy practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which teaches me discipline and perseverance.
🎮 I love playing video games to unwind and explore different worlds.
❓ I'm also someone with an insatiable curiosity and I'm always asking questions to understand how things work.
